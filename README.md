#JS Fundamentals TODO List

Our application creates a To-Do list based on the user's input. 

To get started, clone the repository and open the index.html file in your browser. 

To add to your List, you type in the input box, and click Add To List. 

To remove an item from your list, simply click on the item to move it to the Recently Completed list. 

Items on the Recently Completed list are deleted upon refresh or close of the browser. Items in the To-Do list are persistent.
